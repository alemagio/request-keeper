# About

The idea of this project is to provide an easy way of visualizing requests coming from your WIP client while there is still no server ready.


# Install

You can install it as a dev dependency for your project

```bash
npm install --save-dev request-keeper
```
```bash
yard add -D request-keeper
```

or globally on your system

```bash
npm install -g request-keeper
```

```bash
yarn add --global request-keeper
```

# Usage

Simply create a script on your package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "server": "node_modules/request-keeper/bin/start.js"
}
```

or if you installed it globally you can simply run

```bash
npx request-keeper
```

or simply

```bash
request-keeper
```

Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/list` and see an empty list of requests.
To see in real time your requests what you have to do is send a request to `http://localhost:3000/request/` and you can add any url after the `/`.
